# sms_spam_detector
Week 21 Challenge
This project focused on creating a linear SVC model.  The model gets trained on examples of "ham" and "spam" text based on the classification label used as the target.
We created a gradio app to interact with the model allowing the user to test a message.

#Files
We used the Module 21 Challenge files that included the solution file for code, the csv file with the feature and target information.

#Findings
The model performed fairly well, with 75% correctly identified.  Additional finetuning could be considered to improve the model.
